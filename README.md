# Breath-Analyzer-Hyper-Local-Predictive-Air-Quality-Intelligence-System
AI + IoT + Satellite Data Integration for Real-Time Urban Air Monitoring

# Problem Overview

Air pollution in Indian cities is typically reported as a single city-wide average AQI, masking hyper-local variations that directly impact public health.

Existing systems:

  1.Rely on sparse monitoring stations
  
  2.Lack predictive capabilities
  
  3.Do not integrate multi-source atmospheric intelligence
  
  4.Fail to provide location-specific, real-time insights

There is a need for a predictive, hyper-local air quality intelligence system that combines ground-level and atmospheric data for actionable decision-making.

# Our Approach

Breath-Analyzer is designed as a multi-layer intelligent system that:

  1.Collects real-time environmental parameters using IoT sensors
  
  2.Integrates satellite-derived atmospheric indicators
  
  3.Applies AI models to detect patterns and forecast pollution trends
  
  4.Generates localized risk alerts and recommendations

We focus on prediction + personalization + scalability rather than static AQI reporting.
